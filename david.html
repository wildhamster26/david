		Dougless - Draft #5
		By
		David Shushan
		INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
		A FISH bowl. The fish is named Albert, as the name tag suggests. Through the translucent bowl, we can see a blurry library and abstract figures. One of those figures is DOUG, young male, blends perfectly in the background, with unkempt beard and oversized jacket.
		Doug pushes a book cart. He stops and re-shelves some books. Five years old NORMAN, nerdy looking boy, approaches him.
		NORMAN Hi, I’m Norman.
		.DOUG
		I’m Doug.
		NORMAN Do you work here?
		DOUG
		Yes.
		NORMAN Do you have a wife?
		DOUG
		No
		NORMAN Do you have a dog?
		DOUG
		No
		NORMAN Do you have a best friend?
		Doug is pushing the cart away slightly. Norman follows.
		NORMAN Books can be your friends too, I think. That’s why I like it here. Do you know my mom?
		DOUG
		No
		NORMAN My mom knows many men
		(CONTINUED)
		CONTINUED: 2.
		DOUG
		...
		NORMAN She made my dad move to a different house. I get to have two bedrooms.
		DOUG Can I help you find something?
		NORMAN Can I keep Albert?
		DOUG No, you can’t.
		NORMAN
		Why not?
		DOUG He belongs to the library
		NORMAN But, what does he do here when everyone is gone?
		DOUG I’m not sure
		NORMAN You think he’s reading books?
		DOUG
		No
		Beat. Norman just stares.
		NORMAN I like you, Doug. If you want, I can be your friend.
		DOUG
		Thank you.
		INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
		Doug reshelves books. SUPERVISOR approaches.
		SUPERVISOR Doug, put these on the community board, please. Oh, and you can take your lunch starting [looks at his watch] 1:05. You know what 1:10.
		(CONTINUED)
		CONTINUED: 3.
		Supervisor hands Doug a couple of flyers.
		Doug goes to a big cork board and starts hanging flyers. One flyer draws his attention:
		CU OF FLYER
		"Life after loss: grief support group"
		INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
		THE AUTOMATIC DOORS
		Looking out. The doors open for RANDOM PERSON #1. A DOG is waiting outside for its owner. In the distance, a blurry Doug on his way to the supermarket. As Doug makes his way, the doors occasionally open for other customers leaving or entering.
		Doug is about to enter the supermarket.
		BANG
		He slams into the automatic doors, which didn’t open as they should had.
